			<p>At the crux of advances in tech and industry is a subtext of anxiety—how fast can we go, and how do we stop if we need to? If tradition moves fast enough, does it become tech? We talk GMOs. Zilber explains, “You’re just fundamentally bypassing checks and balances. Nature runs with an even keel, so when you start splicing organisms, changing pathways and allowing them to do things that they didn’t normally do before, you are refining exposure to very large risks.” Zilber shares an anecdote where he spoke with a geneticist farmer whose life’s work has been modifying ubiquitous crops, with little market value to the United States—cassava, rice, sweet potato—for developing countries, to make them more disease-resistant and nutritious, potentially changing the lives of millions of people. For the most part, our attitudes toward GMOs have been informed by the industrial agricultural complex. “Every instance you’ve seen of GMOs has been put into the world by greedy corporations that have their own agendas, and might be employing an incredible technology, but doing it in a way that’s less altruistic.” Proof, maybe, that a technology is only as good as its application. Factory farming and GMOs implement particular methods to override the limitations of seasons, which is essentially what fermentation does—preserving and multiplying nutritional yield. I ask if fermentation can be the antithesis to the industrial agricultural complex, “It is, spiritually,” says David. “For all of the industry’s efforts to reign in the natural world, it exists outside of us, outside of our desires.”</p>
